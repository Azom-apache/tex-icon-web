Bangladesh is well known for being the second-highest RMG exporter in the world due to its industry&#8217;s ability to produce high-quality goods at prices that are competitive with those of its competitors. Bangladesh has had a substantial impact on the global apparel industry, and garment-buying companies are essential to this achievement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><br><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/best-buying-house-in-bangladesh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buying House (BH)<\/a>:<\/strong> A purchasing house essentially acts as a trade partnership between the producer and the buyer\/retailer. In the business world, there are two different sorts of BH: trading\/purchasing offices and buying agencies or liaison offices. Both phrases have distinct connotations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSL-Logo.png\" alt=\"Dongyi Sourcing Ltd Logo\" class=\"wp-image-759\" width=\"361\" height=\"184\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dongyi Sourcing Limited<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><br><strong>History of Bangladesh (Buying House):<\/strong> The export-focused RMG business in Bangladesh began as a tiny, unconventional export sector in the latter half of the 1970s. The RMG sector began to grow rapidly after freedom, notably in the 1990s as the nation attained political and social stability. RMG has changed into the industry that generates the most income for the nation in only three decades. The early \u201990s some entrepreneurs brought the &#8220;buying house&#8221; concept to fulfill industrial demand.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Why need Buying House?<\/strong> In reality, a purchasing house is always essential to the RMG industry. It represents the culmination of all marketing efforts, including finding overseas customers for clothing, gathering orders, using the media on behalf of manufacturers, placing orders with the best factories for producing clothing, and providing a range of technical and communication support to both customers and manufacturers.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Content-Creator-Micro-Influencer-Pinterest-Pin-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1031\" width=\"402\" height=\"599\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dongyi Sourcing Limited (DSL)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br>In Bangladesh&#8217;s garment manufacturing industry, BH is significant. The RMG business in Bangladesh is entirely dependent on international consumers, and consumers abroad depend on garment-buying houses. As a result of their frequent lack of knowledge regarding the country of production, the mode of communication, the culture, the environment, and other relevant factors, apparel buying houses frequently offer them significant assistance by providing them with clothing products that meet their needs. Several of the more well-known buyers created their own office in Bangladesh, which was quite expensive, to lessen their dependency on purchasing homes. For some overseas purchasers, that is not an option. such that the number of new buying houses is growing daily.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"aligncenter wp-block-post-featured-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"624\" src=\"https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header.png\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Feature image\" style=\"object-fit:cover;\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header.png 1920w, https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header-300x98.png 300w, https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header-1024x333.png 1024w, https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header-768x250.png 768w, https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header-1536x499.png 1536w, https:\/\/dongyi.hk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/product-header-600x195.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong>:  By 2030, Bangladesh has a new goal of earning $100 billion from the export of RMG goods.
